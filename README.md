This repository contains the PyTorch implementation for [CVPR 2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/) Paper "Cascaded Human-Object Interaction Recognition" by Tianfei Zhou, Wenguan Wang, Siyuan Qi, Haibin Ling, Jianbing Shen.

Our proposed method reached the __1st__ place in ICCV-2019 Person in Context Challenge1 (PIC19 Challenge), on both [_Human-Object Interaction in the Wild (HOIW)_](http://picdataset.com/challenge/leaderboard/pic2019) and [_Person in Context (PIC)_](http://picdataset.com/challenge/leaderboard/hoi2019) tracks.
