# Cascaded Human-Object Interaction Recognition
---

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation for [CVPR 2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/) Paper "Cascaded Human-Object Interaction Recognition" by [Tianfei Zhou](https://www.tfzhou.com/), [Wenguan Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/wenguanwang/), [Siyuan Qi](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~syqi/), [Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/), [Jianbing Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Q3NTToAAAAJ&hl=en).

Our proposed method reached the __1st__ place in ICCV-2019 Person in Context Challenge (PIC19 Challenge), on both [_Human-Object Interaction in the Wild (HOIW)_](http://picdataset.com/challenge/leaderboard/hoi2019) and [_Person in Context (PIC)_](http://picdataset.com/challenge/leaderboard/pic2019) tracks.
